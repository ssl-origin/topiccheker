Check duplicated title while posting a new topic
Prevent duplicate topics while a new post is written. It displays a few arguments while writing down the subject of the topic.

The goal is to avoid always to repeat to new users "SEARCH BEFORE POST!".
WARNING it is not an accurate search like the one we have in search page, but it's not a bad one! More word you use, better results you will have!
